## Usage

After downloading and launching the app, You will see two screens. the main screen (WeatherScreen) and the favorites screen (FavoritesScreen):

  ```sh
  WeatherScreen
```
In the main screen we have a search field to search a locationâ€™s weather by city name, next to it there is an icon button to add/remove the city from favorites.
Below it, you can see the current weather and a 5-day forecast of the searched location.
And yes, you can click on the current weather temperature unit (C / F) to switch between the units.

  ```sh
  FavoritesScreen
```
In the favorites screen you will find a list of favorite locations. Each location have an ID, name and current weather.

You can make a short press or a long press of any item in the list:

  ```sh
  1. OnPress
```
In this method, clicking on an item will navigate to the main screen showing the details of that location.

  ```sh
  2. OnLongPress
```
In this method, you will enter the Delete mode and will be able to select items from the list, and delete one or more items.
